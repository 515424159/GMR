# Graph-Based Relation-Perceptible Network For Video Question Answering

This is a PyTorch implementation for paper "Graph Structured Relation-Perceptible Network For Video Question Answering"

In this paper, we introduce a new model GSR (Graph Structured Relation-Perceptible Network) with several effective modules to solve the shortcomings in traditional methods: (1) a dependence-aware global sequential module that could obtain potential dependence in the sequence. (2) a graph-based multi-relation module to exploit the spatio-temporal and interactive relationships at object-level. (3) a graph-based cross-modal interaction that obtains a deeper understanding of the multi-modal relationship with a multi-stage interaction structure.
